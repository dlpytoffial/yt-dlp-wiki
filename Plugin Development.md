## How do I create a plugin for yt-dlp?

To see how to write extractors in general, see the [yt-dlp developer instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-instructions).

For information regarding the plugin spec, see the [plugins section of the yt-dlp README](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#plugins).

### Getting Started

1. [Create a new repository based on this template](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-sample-plugins/generate)
2. Check out the source code with:
    `git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git`
3. [Configure your IDE's run and debug configuration](#Run-and-debug-configuration) (optional)
4. Write your plugin code in the `yt_dlp_plugins/<type>` folder (where type is either `extractor` or `postprocessor`). See the sample plugins provided and the [yt-dlp developer instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-instructions) for more details. 
    - Some instructions given will not apply to plugin development, but should give you a good idea on what to do. 
    - The method for testing extractor plugins is the same as with built-in ones.
5. [Configure your plugin package](#Configuring-your-plugin-package)
6. [Add](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add) the new files, [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) them and [push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) the result, like this:
    ```git
     $ git add yt_dlp_plugins setup.cfg README.md
     $ git commit -m 'Add yourplugin plugin'
     $ git push origin master
    ```

---

### Configuring your plugin package

1. Modify [setup.cfg](setup.cfg) with your plugin's name and version. It is recommended to bump the version whenever you make changes or a new release.
2. Update the installation instructions in [README.md](README.md) to point to this repository.
3. Add `yt-dlp-plugins` to the repository tags for discoverability.
4. Be sure to remove any of the sample extractors/post-processors.

### Run and debug configuration
1. Set your IDE's run configuration to point to the `yt_dlp` Python module.
2. Add your project's root directory containing `yt_dlp_plugins` to `PYTHONPATH` environment variable (this may not be necessary with some IDE run configurations)
3. The `yt_dlp_plugins` folder should be automatically picked up by yt-dlp (run with `-v` to check)

### Importing extractors from other plugins

```py
from yt_dlp_plugins.extractor.example import ExampleIE
```

This works regardless of where the `example` plugin is installed on the system, as long as yt-dlp can find it. 
Your IDE may not be able to resolve the import, but it will work at runtime.

If the user does not have the `example` plugin installed, the import will fail and your extractor will not be imported (but yt-dlp will continue to run). 

The same applies for any other plugin type.

### Poetry configuration

If you want your plugin to be installable with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), you can add the following to your `pyproject.toml`:

```
[tool.poetry]
...
packages = [{ include = "yt_dlp_plugins" }]
...
```

See the [Poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#packages) for more details.
