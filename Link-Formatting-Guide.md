##This Idea has came to me, Initially, because I am not a programmer and I do not have anything to do with web-dev or anything tech-related.
#When I saw that "you're the tube Lt" keep changing the links with no user in mind, I opened an issue here <Issue Link>
### One of the respected contributors said that I did not format the link correctly, and here I wonder; How can I format the link correctly?
####When I opened your wiki, I didn't find a guide on formatting the new links, which puts me (as a tech-illeterate user) in a hard situation.
**I mean I really hate web development and servers and stuff, so I thought that the only thing I can do at the moment is to suggest a wiki page.
*I think any experienced user can help me build this page, and I am ready to write and contribute to the wiki with my humble abilities in writing.
